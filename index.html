      <p class="excerpt">Greetings! My name is Afshin, I was born and raised in Iran. I went to university to study Civil engineering after graduating from high school, but after a couple of years, I found myself uninterested in that subject so I decided to start new and moved to Denmark in 2012 in order to pursue education and follow my passion and living here since then.</br></br>I am a web developer with skills in both server and client side programming and after completing my bachelor's degree in web development I found interest in front-end technologies and interactive design.</br></br>I enjoy designing and creating websites with a beautiful and user-friendly interface. and I pride myself on being a professional who can be counted on to meet deadlines and communicate well throughout the process. You can check out some of my projects I have done for clients in my old <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/afshinmoatari/" class="link" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> and on my <a href="https://github.com/AfshinMoatari" class="link" target="_blank">Github</a> page.
