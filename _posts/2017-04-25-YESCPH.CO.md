<a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/company/yescph-co" target="_blank">YES CPH CO</a>  is a facility service company that works towards alleviating some key social issues in Denmark and around the world. I have worked as a WordPress/Front End Developer and took the concept and converted them into the homepage for this startup. Creating the assets from design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and turning them into a WordPress site, setting up the theme, the plugins, and the content in a way that sets up the company for success.

## WordPress theme

The WordPress theme is built with PHP, CSS, and HTML, ensuring compatibility with W3Schools standards. Designed with a mobile-first approach, it supports dynamic content generation, includes customizable theme modification elements, and works seamlessly across all devices and browsers. You can check out a demo of this theme <a href="https://afshinmoatari.github.io/YES-website/" target="_blank">here</a>.
