categories:
- projects
---

As part of my Master's project while studying for my MSc in IT Web Communication Design, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of social media hashtags related to significant social movements. This project utilized data from Twitter to explore the sentiments and trends surrounding the hashtags **#ICantBreathe**, **#TamirRice**, and **#BlackLivesMatter**.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on extracting and analyzing data from Twitter to provide insights into public sentiment and engagement regarding these critical social issues. By leveraging R and various data visualization techniques, the project aims to present a clear picture of how these movements resonate within the community. For data mining, I utilized the [TweetScraper](https://github.com/jonbakerfish/TweetScraper), a simple crawler for Twitter Search that operates without using the Twitter API.

### Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Implemented methods to collect and preprocess Twitter data for the specified hashtags using the TweetScraper.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of data trends and patterns using R's powerful visualization libraries.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted various statistical analyses to derive meaningful insights from the data, including sentiment analysis and engagement metrics.
- **Documentation**: Provided thorough documentation and README files for each analysis project to guide users through the setup and usage.
