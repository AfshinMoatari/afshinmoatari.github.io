<a href="https://cse.cbs.dk/" target="_blank">Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship</a> is Copenhagen Business School entrepreneurial incubator, where more than 100 startups with students from all universities do their daily work. I have worked as a WordPress/Front End Developer and took the concepts and converted them into the homepage for this organization. Creating the assets from design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and turning them into a WordPress site, setting up the theme, the plugins, and the content in a way that sets up the organization for success.

## WordPress theme

The WordPress theme is built with PHP, CSS, and HTML, ensuring compatibility with W3Schools standards. Designed with a mobile-first approach, it supports dynamic content generation, includes customizable theme modification elements, and works seamlessly across all devices and browsers. You can check out a demo of this theme <a href="https://afshinmoatari.github.io/CSE/" target="_blank">here</a>.
