## Blazor Server & Blazor WebAssembly Applications

During my time at Better Folks, I held multiple positions, one of which was as a back-office employee in the role of .NET Full Stack Developer. In this capacity, I developed two web applications using ASP.NET Core Blazor and Blazor WebAssembly:

1. **Operations Management and Administration Tool**: This tool facilitates business service activities, helping organizations achieve their goals, enhance productivity, and maximize profitability while improving communication.
   
2. **Client Application**: Designed to minimize client involvement in day-to-day operations, this application provides a more intelligent way to manage everyday tasks, enhancing user experience and connecting clients with service employees.

### Here are some screenshots from the client application environment:
