<a href="https://www.impactly.dk/product/overview" target="_blank">Impactly</a> is a Danish product scaleup that enables companies and organizations to measure, manage, and report on the social impact of their social services, impact investments, and ESRS ‘S’ initiatives. Impactly provides digital solutions to foundations, investors, service providers, municipalities, and regions to determine the social change that investments create for their citizens. The software consists of tools that allow these organizations to access validated impact metrics, streamline data collection, measure social impact, and generate Social Return on Investment (SROI) reports.

## .NET Core & React Stack

During my time at Impactly, I worked as a full-stack developer. Their stack consists of a React TypeScript frontend with a .NET Core backend, including various AWS services. The management platform focuses on efficient data collection, assessment, analysis, and representation of outcomes in various forms of social and economic values.

## The Platform Can Be Divided into the Following Parts:

1. **Strategies and Data Collection**: This component helps organizations measure outcomes efficiently with a structured data strategy, replacing complex spreadsheets with validated methods. It improves scientific rigor and streamlines data collection through automated features.

2. **Reporting**: This feature turns outcome data into meaningful insights, focusing on a real-time overview of the organization's impact with customization, sharing, anonymity features, and a dedicated dashboard.
