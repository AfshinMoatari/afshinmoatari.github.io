The **SocialSpace** platform is designed to provide support and guidance to children and young people facing various challenges in their everyday lives. As a sister company to **Impactly ApS**, SocialSpace operates as a non-governmental organization (NGO) that offers a secure and anonymous way for users to connect with social counseling services. I contributed to the development of the SocialSpace platform, focusing on enhancing their CI/CD pipeline, backend .NET API, and Flutter application.

## Project Overview

SocialSpace serves as a personal guide to help users find the right support for their specific needs. The platform aggregates various social counseling offers, making it easier for users to access help through chat or video calls. My contributions aimed to improve the platform's functionality and deployment processes, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
