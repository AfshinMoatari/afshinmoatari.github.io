I worked as a WordPress/Front End Developer to create a custom theme for their website, transforming their vision into a functional and visually appealing online presence. This involved designing assets using tools like Adobe Illustrator and implementing them into a WordPress site, setting up the theme, plugins, and content to ensure a seamless user experience.
